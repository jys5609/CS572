Auto lip-reading is a promising method for enhancing speech recognition, by combining the audio input with a visual.
In this work we evaluate the usage of a combined method of the classical approach to ALR where handcrafted feature extraction is used, with the more modern approach where end-to-end neural network is used.
In particular we investigate the combination of optical flow and key feature extraction in combination with neural networks, such as convolutional networks and Long short-term memory.
The performance of each of these systems is compared to the current state-of-the-art architecture.
